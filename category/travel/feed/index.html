<h4><em><strong>Save up to </strong></em>$40<em><strong> and travel the world with Airbnb!</strong></em></h4>



<p>Some days ago I wrote a guide on <a href="https://tipsfromfederica.com/uber-first-ride-free/">how to claim a free ride on Uber</a> but today I want to share something even better: keep reading and you&#8217;ll discover how to archive a <strong>$40</strong> Airbnb discount code for free.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Were you looking for a guide about renting your house on Airbnb? <a href="https://www.icodicidifederica.it/invita-un-host-airbnb/">Read here!</a></p></blockquote>



<p>In the last few years I visited more than 10 different countries and I&#8217;ve often used <strong>Airbnb to find private rooms or houses to stay</strong>. Airbnb is growing in popularity very fast; as a result it&#8217;s becoming a standard in many cities with a huge amount of accommodations for all budgets.<br>Therefore, I consider Airbnb the best renting site currently in circulation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.smartworld.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/airbnb-gif-final-1280x720.gif" alt="Airbnb, il più celebre sito per trovare un alloggio per la tua prossima vacanza"/><figcaption>Airbnb is the well-known website for those are looking for an accomodation</figcaption></figure>



<h4>What makes Airbnb a <em>must</em>-have for travellers?</h4>



<ul><li><strong>1. Huge accomodations availability:</strong> No matter if you are looking for a luxury apartment in Buenos Aires or a bedroom in Rio de Janeiro, whatever you are looking for, you can definitely find it on Airbnb.</li><li><strong>2. Prices:</strong> There is a big difference between hotels and a private apartments in terms of costs. When booking accommodation directly from a private individual, <strong>prices are much lower</strong> and that makes Airbnb a cheaper solution.</li><li><strong>3. Opportunity to meet local people:</strong> One of Airbnb&#8217;s strengths is the possibility of getting in touch with people who know the city and with whom you can share many stories, dinners, or simply a beer at the local pub.</li><li><strong>4. Security:</strong> The increasing popularity of Airbnb has increased the security of using this website. In all the bookings I made I never had any problems. Above all, I always found very comfortable, clean and well-located apartments and private rooms around the world.</li></ul>



<p>Are you in a hurry? Here is the quick link to receive the $40 Airbnb discount code.</p>
