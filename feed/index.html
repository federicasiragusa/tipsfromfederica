<h4>Enjoy your free ride with Uber, the popular taxi app.</h4>



<p>Are you looking for a ride but you&#8217;re low on funds? Today is your lucky day: I have an Uber discount code that could make your Uber first ride free!</p>



<p>As you might have already noticed, I’m a huge fan of promo codes and discount codes in all their shapes. This is my Italian website, but I&#8217;m starting to write my new blog post either in English to improve my languages skills.</p>



<p>Using a discount code will lead you to incredible experiences.<br> Let&#8217;s consider the case of <a href="https://www.tipsfromfederica.com/airbnb-discount-code/">Airbnb</a>. I wrote an article where I give you <br> a <a href="https://www.tipsfromfederica.com/airbnb-discount-code/">$40 Airbnb Discount Code</a> for your first reservation on Airbnb.<br> Have a look at the incredibles houses listed on Airbnb worldwide!</p>



<h3>Uber first ride free using this coupon on registration</h3>



<p>Back to Uber, if you haven’t already joined Uber then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/j1gkyf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (apre in una nuova scheda)">you seriously need to</a>&nbsp;do so. Anytime you&#8217;ll need a taxi service, just check it up. You&#8217;ll find its price cheaper compared to anyone else. </p>



<p>Do you want to try it? <strong>If you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/j1gkyf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (apre in una nuova scheda)">use this link</a> to register on Uber, you’ll get $20 off your first Uber first ride free!</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-background" href="https://www.uber.com/invite/j1gkyf" style="background-color:#febe03">CLAIM YOUR FREE RIDE NOW</a></div>



<p>The Uber app lets you order a taxi, get an estimate of how much the journey will cost and it can even allow you to split the bill with anyone else with whom you’re riding.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/UBER-BLACK-ROMA1.jpg" alt="An Uber driver ready to give you your first ride free"/><figcaption>If you don&#8217;t know nothing about Uber you can <a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/ride/how-it-works/">read this official post</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Are you looking for an even cheaper way to use Uber?</h3>



<p>Select the Uber pool option, which allows you to make your journey with others traveling in the same direction. Your trip may take a bit more time (as you may have to pick up and drop off other passengers along the way) but the fare will be split amongst all of you.</p>



<p>Get your Uber first ride free when you&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (apre in una nuova scheda)" href="https://www.uber.com/invite/j1gkyf" target="_blank">sign up to Uber using this link</a>&nbsp;or with the invite code&nbsp;<strong>jlgkyf</strong>.</p>



<p>Consider it as an Uber discount code, as you will get $20 off your first ride! Depending on how far you go, this could probably mean a completely free Uber ride coupon.</p>



<h3>Earn even more Uber free rides</h3>



<p>Here is the procedure to follow to apply for your Uber first ride free when you sign up for a new account.</p>



<ol><li>Download the Uber app on your phone (or just&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (apre in una nuova scheda)" href="https://www.uber.com/invite/j1gkyf" target="_blank">click here</a>&nbsp;to sign up)</li><li>When you sign up and log in using the app, find the Payment section on the left, where you can &#8220;Add Promo/Gift Code&#8221;. Plug in the Uber promo code&nbsp;<strong>jlgkyf</strong> and press ok.</li><li>That’s it! Your coupon will be automatically applied on your first Uber ride.</li></ol>



<p>When you sign up for Uber you’re given your own invite code. You can then use this Uber promo code to get people to sign up using your own code. In this way, not only do they get a free Uber ride (of up to <strong>$20</strong>), but so do you.</p>



<p>It may also happen Uber to offer even more free rides in special occasions, which it often will.</p>



<p>Join the virtuous circle of receiving and giving free Uber rides, and &#8220;<strong><em>Buon Viaggio&#8221; </em></strong>from Federica<strong><em>!</em></strong></p>

<h4><em><strong>Save up to </strong></em>$40<em><strong> and travel the world with Airbnb!</strong></em></h4>



<p>Some days ago I wrote a guide on <a href="https://www.tipsfromfederica.com/uber-first-ride-free/">how to claim a free ride on Uber</a> but today I want to share something even better: keep reading and you&#8217;ll discover how to archive a <strong>$40</strong> Airbnb discount code for free.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Were you looking for a guide about renting your house on Airbnb? <a href="https://www.icodicidifederica.it/invita-un-host-airbnb/">Read here!</a></p></blockquote>



<p>In the last few years I visited more than 10 different countries and I&#8217;ve often used <strong>Airbnb to find private rooms or houses to stay</strong>. Airbnb is growing in popularity very fast; as a result it&#8217;s becoming a standard in many cities with a huge amount of accommodations for all budgets.<br>Therefore, I consider Airbnb the best renting site currently in circulation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.smartworld.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/airbnb-gif-final-1280x720.gif" alt="Airbnb, il più celebre sito per trovare un alloggio per la tua prossima vacanza"/><figcaption>Airbnb is the well-known website for those are looking for an accomodation</figcaption></figure>



<h4>What makes Airbnb a <em>must</em>-have for travellers?</h4>



<ul><li><strong>1. Huge accomodations availability:</strong> No matter if you are looking for a luxury apartment in Buenos Aires or a bedroom in Rio de Janeiro, whatever you are looking for, you can definitely find it on Airbnb.</li><li><strong>2. Prices:</strong> There is a big difference between hotels and a private apartments in terms of costs. When booking accommodation directly from a private individual, <strong>prices are much lower</strong> and that makes Airbnb a cheaper solution.</li><li><strong>3. Opportunity to meet local people:</strong> One of Airbnb&#8217;s strengths is the possibility of getting in touch with people who know the city and with whom you can share many stories, dinners, or simply a beer at the local pub.</li><li><strong>4. Security:</strong> The increasing popularity of Airbnb has increased the security of using this website. In all the bookings I made I never had any problems. Above all, I always found very comfortable, clean and well-located apartments and private rooms around the world.</li></ul>



<p>Are you in a hurry? Here is the quick link to receive the $40 Airbnb discount code.</p>

<h4>How to travel (almost) for free with the Airbnb discount code</h4>



<p>Here&#8217;s in detail how to earn even more Airbnb travel credits to start <strong>saving on each booking.</strong> It&#8217;s easy as a pie.</p>



<p>Register on Airbnb <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/federicas1462?currency=USD">following this link</a> and set up your new account; in this way you&#8217;ve earned something between $35 and $45 to use in your first booking. However, Airbnb often changes this amount and you can find out the exact amount by clicking on the above link.</p>
